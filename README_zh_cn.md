# Ender Pearl TP-MCDR
Cost some ender pearls to teleport to anywhere, a xyz position, or someone.

## Usage
Use `!!etp <player_name>` to teleport to someone.

**NOTE: please confirm that you typed a correct name, or your ender pearls will lost without teleport success.**
> This will be fixed in future. Luckily, you'll still be prevented from teleporting to yourself.

Use `!!etp Pos <x> <y> <z>` to teleport to a xyz-like position.

**NOTE: please confirm that you typed a correct position, because you can't regret.**
> `<x>`, `<y>`, `<z>` should be float num. Regret function will update in the future.

## Config
Server owners set "cost" to a integer num in `config/ender_pearl_tp/config.json` to decide how many ender pearls players should cost to teleport where they want.

Default "cost" is 4.
