# Ender Pearl TP-MCDR
Cost some ender pearls to teleport to anywhere, a xyz position, or someone.

This plugin may works fine in the server MCDR supported.

## Usage
Use `!!etp <player_name>` to teleport to someone.

Use `!!etp Pos <x> <y> <z>` to teleport to a xyz-like position.

Use `!!etp back` to teleport back with no refunds of ender pearls you cost.

## Config
Server owners set "cost" to a integer num in `config/ender_pearl_tp/config.json` to decide how many ender pearls players should cost to teleport where they want.

Default "cost" is 4.
